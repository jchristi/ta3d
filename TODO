bug list
--------
_There should be either restriction to use 12-icon build menu on resolutions lesser than 1024x768 or it should be sizeable, since now on 800x600 or 640x480 size of 12-icon build menu don`t match size of othe GUI parts and covers some of function buttons.
_slow down with lots of 3D sprites on some gfx hardware (speed increased but bug not yet fixed)
_fix all other bugs ( :-) )

* map bloc visibility test fixed
* AI can now place metal extractors directly where they should be placed
* weapons don't go through their target without hitting them !!
* invisible units are visible when an enemy is close enough
* fixed very ugly bug that could allow a unit to acquire a wrong target if the target has died and been replaced in memory before the mission is executed !
* fixed units being spawned not being cleared correctly from yard map
* fixed unit colors being wrong when texture cache is enabled
* fixed nanospray sometimes going to space
* fixed crash in Config->Audio when clicking something with no music listed
* fixed lots of bugs in networking code
* fixed some transparency drawing bugs with trees
* fixed tactical icons hidden by map geometry
* fixed some bugs in networking code
* fixed click on hidden widgets when floatting menus are unrolled
* enable ATI workarounds with SIS cards
* fixed gui bug with floatting menus : "when the pointer is over a floatting menu, it selects without clicking (config menu) ..."
* fixed : the second mission of arm campaign is no more won immediately ...

idea list
