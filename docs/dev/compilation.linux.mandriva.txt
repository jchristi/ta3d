Compilation under Mandriva
===========================

Current instructions are for Mandriva 2008.1, it should also work with previous versions
of Mandriva.

1 - CMake
---------

You need CMake 2.6 in order to build TA3D. It's not present in repositories, so you'll
have to build it yourself unless you want to try a RPM from a different distribution.
go to www.cmake.org and download cmake-2.6.*.tar.gz, then extract it, follow cmake
build instructions and install it.

2 - GCC and required libraries
------------------------------

You need GCC with C++ support (g++) to build TA3D, just install gcc-c++ like any
other software using your package manager. Then you'll need to install the headers of
zlib and allegro : zlib1-devel, allegro4.2-devel (will install Allegro 4.2 if not done)

Now you're done with the packages. Let's install AllegroGL, you can download it from:
www.allegro.cc

extract AllegroGL's archive and run :
# ./fix.sh unix
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install

now AllegroGL should be installed.

NB: TA3D requires Allegro >= 4.2.2, if you use an older version of
Mandriva you may have to build it yourself.

3 - FMOD
--------

FMOD is a sound/music library, there is no package for it so you'll have to download and install 
it
manually. You'll find it here:
www.fmod.org

we recommend you use the latest stable version (>= 4.16.x at the time of writing those 
instructions)

4 - TA3D
--------

Now you can build ta3d:
> cmake ./
> make

PS: If you get an error message with something like ...<anonymous>...
edit the /usr/local/include/allegrogl/GLext/gl_ext_api.h file, and
find the line:
AGL_API(void, EndTransformFeedbackNV,     (GLvoid))
replace GLvoid with void
now it should build :)

NB: if you're using a NVidia card, you will probably run into crashes when the game
starts. To fix that, install the -devel package of the nvidia driver, then run ldconfig
as root. This is due to TA3D loading both NVidia's and mesa libraries ...
