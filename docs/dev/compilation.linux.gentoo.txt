Compilation under Gentoo
========================


1 - CMake
---------

You need CMake 2.6 in order to build TA3D. Just emerge it as any other software.

2 - GCC and required libraries
------------------------------

You need GCC with C++ support (g++) to build TA3D, on Gentoo you should have it :D
Then you'll need to install zlib, allegro ( >= 4.2.2 ) and AllegroGL (>= 0.4.3 recommended)

3 - FMOD
--------

FMOD is a sound/music library, you can emerge it but won't probably be the last version, we recommend you
install it manually. You'll find it here:
www.fmod.org

we recommend you use the latest stable version (>= 4.16.x at the time of writing those instructions)

4 - TA3D
--------

Now you can build ta3d:
> cmake ./
> make

PS: If you get an error message with something like ...<anonymous>...
edit the /usr/local/include/allegrogl/GLext/gl_ext_api.h file, and
find the line:
AGL_API(void, EndTransformFeedbackNV,     (GLvoid))
replace GLvoid with void
now it should build :)
