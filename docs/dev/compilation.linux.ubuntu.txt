Compilation under Ubuntu
=========================


1 - CMake
---------

You need CMake 2.6 in order to build TA3D. You can install it from the backports
repository (only 2.4 is in main). Enable hardy-backports, then use your favorite
package manager to install cmake 2.6

2 - GCC and required libraries
------------------------------

You need GCC with C++ support (g++) to build TA3D, just install g++ like any other
software using your package manager. Then you'll need to install the headers of
zlib and allegro : zlib1g-dev, liballegro4.2-dev (will install Allegro 4.2 if not done)

Now you're done with the packages. Let's install AllegroGL, you can download it from:
www.allegro.cc

extract AllegroGL's archive and run :
# ./fix.sh unix
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install

now AllegroGL should be installed.

NB: TA3D requires Allegro >= 4.2.2, if you use an older version of
Ubuntu you'll have to build it yourself.

3 - FMOD
--------

FMOD is a sound/music library, there is no package for it so you'll have to download and install it
manually. You'll find it here:
www.fmod.org

we recommend you use the latest stable version (>= 4.16.x at the time of writing those instructions)

4 - TA3D
--------

Now you can build ta3d:
> cmake ./
> make

PS: If you get an error message with something like ...<anonymous>...
edit the /usr/local/include/allegrogl/GLext/gl_ext_api.h file, and
find the line:
AGL_API(void, EndTransformFeedbackNV,     (GLvoid))
replace GLvoid with void
now it should build :)
